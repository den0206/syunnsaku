# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal project called "syunsaku" with very limited structure. The repository contains only a basic README.md file with the text "sample".

## Project Structure

- `README.md` - Contains minimal project information
- No package.json, build files, or source code detected
- No dependencies or build system configured

## Development Commands

No build, test, or lint commands are available as there is no package.json or build configuration present.

## Architecture Notes

This appears to be an empty or newly initialized project with minimal content. Future development would need to establish:
- Project type and technology stack
- Build system and dependency management
- Testing framework
- Code organization structure
